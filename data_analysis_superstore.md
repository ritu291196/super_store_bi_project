**Summary:** In this project, I analysed the sales data of Super Store, a small retail business in the US, and identified the best selling and most profitable categories, sub-categories, customer segments, regions, and cities. I also used time series analysis and forecasting techniques to predict the future sales and profit trends of Super Store. I used SQL, Microsoft excel, Power Bi tool to perform the data manipulation, visualization, and modelling tasks. The main findings and recommendations are:

-   The most profitable category is Technology, followed by Furniture and Office Supplies. The best selling sub-category is Phones, followed by Chairs and Storage.
-   The most profitable customer segment is Home Office, followed by Corporate and Consumer. The preferred ship mode is Standard Class, followed by Second Class and First Class.
-   The most profitable region is West, followed by East and South. The city with the highest number of sales is New York City, followed by Los Angeles and Seattle.
-   The sales and profit of Super Store show a seasonal pattern, with peaks in November and December, and dips in January and February. The overall trend is positive, indicating a growing business.
-   The forecast for the next 12 months shows that the sales and profit will continue to increase, reaching a peak in December 2024. The forecast also shows that the sales and profit will be higher in the West region than in the other regions.

**Recommendations:** Based on the analysis and forecast, I recommend that Super Store should:

-   Focus more on selling Technology products, especially Phones, as they have the highest profit margin and demand.
-   Target more Home Office customers, as they have the highest profit per order and loyalty.
-   Expand more in the West region, as it has the highest potential for growth and profitability.
-   Optimize the inventory management and shipping costs, especially during the peak season in November and December.
-   Monitor the sales and profit trends regularly and adjust the marketing strategies accordingly.
